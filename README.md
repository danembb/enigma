## self_evaluation:

#functionality:
Between meets expectations and below expectations. Though the encrypt and decrypt do work, they do not work completely successfully.

#object-oriented-programming:
Meets expectations. I feel my code is clean and each method is tested, in addition, I can talk to what each method and line of code is doing.

#ruby conventions and mechanics:
Meets expectations. My code has clear methods and I have implemented some efficient methods along with a hash for the ::enigma class.

#test-driven-development:
Meets expectations. Each method in my code has been tested and simplecov gives a consistently >99% coverage.
