# enigma:
Turing 2105 class final project

## process:
* Create a program that will first, ask a user if they would like to enter in code to be encrypted.

  - If yes, it will take the 5 digit number and encrypt it using a custom caesar cipher
  - If no, it will generate a random 5 digit number, show it, then encrypt it.

  - After, it will ask if the user wants it to decrypt their code. if y/Y it will run a decrypt process, if n/N, it will close the program.


## self_evaluation:

#functionality: 
Between meets expectations and below expectations. Though the encrypt and decrypt do work, they do not work completely successfully.

#object-oriented-programming:
Meets expectations. I feel my code is clean and each method is tested, in addition, I can talk to what each method and line of code is doing.

#ruby conventions and mechanics:
Meets expectations. My code has clear methods and I have implemented some efficient methods along with a hash for the ::enigma class.

#test-driven-development:
Meets expectations. Each method in my code has been tested and simplecov gives a consistently >99% coverage.
