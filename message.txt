Any time I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings taken shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try and explain, I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face and the human cannonball
I need to, I want to come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you
